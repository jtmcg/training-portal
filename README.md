This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# The Design Story
I wanted to outline my design process here, to give you a little more insight into how I operate as a designer and developer.

### Understanding the Problem/Idea Dump
The first step I take in any project is to write down a plan for the design and code. This means throw anything and everything I can think of onto paper related to the project. That way, I've already considered most contingencies necessary if I run into problems with the code. Here's a picture of my idea dump for this project:

### Sketching
Next, I sketch my design. This is especially useful for React, because it allows me to identify components, state, and children. The Idea Dump and Sketch took me about 45 min - 1 hr. Here's my design below. The colored boxes represent the structure I imagined for the development of the project:

### Prototyping
Next, I built the app with no styles involved to get a functional skeleton of the project. This took me about 2.5 hours total. This is what it looked like when I had it functioning.

### Styling/Polishing
Next I added styles and polish to the design, and tested thoroughly. This part usually takes the longest, probably about 4.5 hrs total:

### Deploying
Last is deployment, which you've found here on my github. To check out the functioning app yourself, download it and run `npm install` in the root directory.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
